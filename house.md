# House

We both fell in love with the Evanston community.
And we managed to find a house for in South East Evanston only one block from the Lake!

**743 Michigan Ave** had it all for us.

It is a Craftman's style house with beautiful wookwork on the inside.
We were looking for something with the charm of an older house.
Built in 1914 it is a century old home with lots of stories to tell, and built how they don't built houses anymore.
But it has been updated over the years, so we have a modern kitchen with heated floors and solar panels on the roof for green energy.
And we only have a 10 min walk to the Purple Line and Metra Station, so that we can still conveniently visit Chicago and our city friends can still visit us!
And we love the Main/Dempster mile area in Evanston with all of its family owned stores. For example, this is where we found "Virag Jewlers" for our wedding bands and it is also home of our favorite trivia coffee house, "Evanston Pour".
