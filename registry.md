# Registry

For our married life together, we just bought our [new house in Evanston](/house).
We love it to pieces, but it is a century house that will need a lot of care and upkeep.
If you want to support us in our new married life together, we ask for help with our new house.

One way to help us is a [gift card for our local home depot](https://www.homedepot.com/c/gift-cards) for home projects.
There are a lot things that need attention soon, like new hardware, electrical upgrades, and very important, building a "catio" :D.

We will still need breaks from all the projects, and one of our favorite activities is the trivia night at Evanston Pour.
So a small [gift card for there](https://squareup.com/gift/ML3TN2ECWVGH9/order) is appreciated.

Costco also has a lot of good options to fill our new home, so we appreciate a [gift card for Costco](https://www.costco.com/gift-cards-tickets.html) as well.

We have a [Fresh Market](https://www.thefreshmarket.com/products/the-fresh-market-gift-card) in the neighborhood and we enjoy it for it high-quality food options to cook.

[Lucky Platter](https://www.toasttab.com/theluckyplatter/giftcards?utm_source=undefined&utm_content=online--theluckyplatter&utm_medium=toast_sites&utm_campaign=giftcards) is a local brunch spot and diner with food on the healthier side that we really enjoy. It also features a nice pantry with local food stuffs.
