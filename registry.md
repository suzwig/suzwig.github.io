# Registry

For our married life together, we just bought [our new house](/house) in Evanston.
We love it to pieces, but it is a century house that will need a lot of care and upkeep.
We also made a hefty down payment on our lovely house so we are MORE than OK with cash and checks as well to help replenish our savings!

We love it to pieces, but it is a century house that will need a lot of care and upkeep.
If you want to support us in our new married life together, we ask for help with our new house.

One way to help us is a [gift card for our local home depot](https://www.homedepot.com/c/gift-cards) for home projects.
There are a lot things that need attention soon, like new hardware, tools, electrical upgrades, and very important, building a "catio" :D.
We will also have a back yard in our new house, so if you would like to support our new gardening efforts [Chalet Garden and Home Goods](https://chaletnursery.com/products/digital-gift-card?_pos=2&_psq=gift+cards&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=40352008863878) is a good local choice for us.

We will still need breaks from all the projects, and one of our favorite activities is the trivia night at Evanston Pour.
So a small [gift card for there](https://squareup.com/gift/ML3TN2ECWVGH9/order) is appreciated.
Similarly, [Sea Ranch Sushi](https://www.searanchsushi.com/gift-cards) is our go to dinner for the trivia events at Pour.

Costco also has a lot of good options to fill our new home, so we appreciate a [gift card for Costco](https://www.costco.com/gift-cards-tickets.html) as well.

We have a [Fresh Market](https://www.thefreshmarket.com/products/the-fresh-market-gift-card) in the neighborhood and we enjoy it for it high-quality food options to cook.

[Lucky Platter](https://www.toasttab.com/theluckyplatter/giftcards?utm_source=undefined&utm_content=online--theluckyplatter&utm_medium=toast_sites&utm_campaign=giftcards) is a local brunch spot and diner with food on the healthier side that we really enjoy. It also features a nice pantry with local food stuffs.
Another local restaurant we enjoy is [Trattoria D.O.C.](https://trattoria-doc.com/gift-cards), an Italian Restaurant on Main street, steps from our house, in Evanston.

And since you know us, you know that we will always have use for more [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us/gift-cards).

We specifically decided not to include Amazon here in our registry, because while versatile we prefer to shop locally.
If you want to give us more options of what to use your gift for, Evanston has a downtown wide [gift card option](https://downtownevanston.org/gift-card).
